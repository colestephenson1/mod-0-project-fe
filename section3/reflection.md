## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

It was tough at first, but I recalled much from the growth mindset podcast video and used what I learned there to help. I observed my stress but didn't panic, and used google/youtube as a resource to find the answers. I also posted in slack a couple times and found help from classmates. With a little time and effort, I've been able to figure things out.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Youtube saves videos in an array as a playlist. For example, the array is "videos saved for later", and the items in the array are the specific videos you choose.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

commands that make changes to a given array. Most common uses are adding/deleting a value from the front/back of an array.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

Loops save us time by running a process as many times as needed until complete automatically instead of manually one instance at a time.

You would use a loop with an array when you want to apply a condition to a set of values all at one time. By grouping the values of the array together and applying the condition to the array, you save time and minimize errors.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

When you ride a carousel, each ride will go around the circle 10 times. Each time you pass by the beginning, a little box keeps track of how many times around that is. When that box sees you've gone around 10 times, it stops the ride so other people can go. Thats a loop.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I'd love to see some of these concepts applied in real-life applications. I'm sure there is additional context to learn before any of that makes sense, but I'm itching to see how developers use the concepts in everyday work.
